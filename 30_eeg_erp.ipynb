    "\n",
    "The most common measures of amplitude and latency are peak measures.\n",

    "\n",
    "Peak measures can be obtained using the :meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` method.\n",
    "There are two important things to point out about\n",
    ":meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak`. First, it finds the strongest peak\n",
    "looking across **all channels** of the selected type that are available in\n",
    "the :class:`~mne.Evoked` object. As a consequence, if you want to restrict\n",
    "the search to a group of channels or a single channel, you\n",
    "should first use the :meth:`~mne.Evoked.pick` or\n",
    ":meth:`~mne.Evoked.pick_channels` methods. Second, the\n",
    ":meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` method can find different types of peaks using\n",
    "the ``mode`` argument. There are three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``mode='pos'``: finds the peak with a positive voltage (ignores\n",
    "  negative voltages)\n",
    "* ``mode='neg'``: finds the peak with a negative voltage (ignores\n",
    "  positive voltages)\n",
    "* ``mode='abs'``: finds the peak with the largest absolute voltage\n",
    "  regardless of sign (positive or negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates how to find the first positive peak in the\n",
    "ERP (i.e., the P100) for the left visual condition (i.e., the\n",
    "``l_vis`` :class:`~mne.Evoked` object). The time window used to search for\n",
    "the peak ranges from 0.08 to 0.12 s. This time window was selected because it\n",
